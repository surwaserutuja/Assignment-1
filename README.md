Web Application Mimicking Google Sheets
This project is a web application that mimics the functionality of Google Sheets. It provides a spreadsheet-like interface where users can create, edit, and manage data in a tabular format. The application is built using modern web technologies and is designed to be lightweight, responsive, and user-friendly.

Features
Tabular Interface: A grid-based interface for entering and managing data.

Real-Time Editing: Supports real-time updates to cell values.

Formulas and Calculations: Basic support for formulas and calculations (e.g., SUM, AVERAGE).

Save and Load: Save your work locally and load it later.

Responsive Design: Works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.

Keyboard Shortcuts: Supports common keyboard shortcuts for navigation and editing.

Technologies Used
Frontend: React.js

Styling: CSS or a CSS framework (e.g., Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap)

State Management: React Hooks (useState, useEffect)

Backend (Optional): Node.js, Express.js (for saving/loading data)

Local Storage: For saving and loading data locally.

Save and Load:

Click the Save button to save your work to local storage.

Click the Load button to load previously saved data.

Keyboard Shortcuts:

Ctrl + S: Save the sheet.

Customization
Adding More Features
Advanced Formulas: Extend the formula parser to support more functions.

Collaboration: Integrate with a backend to enable real-time collaboration.

Export Options: Add support for exporting data to CSV or Excel.

Example: Adding a New Formula
To add a new formula, update the formula parser in Sheet.js:

javascript
Copy
const evaluateFormula = (formula) => {
  if (formula.startsWith('=SUM(')) {
    const range = formula.match(/\((.*?)\)/)[1];
    const [start, end] = range.split(':');
    // Calculate the sum of the range
  }
  // Add more formula handlers here
};
